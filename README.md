This is a collection of scripts that I've written.  Some are for giving hints to NYT puzzle games while others are for small computer tasks.

letterfrequencycount.sh reads a text file and reports how often each letter appears.  I use it when I have a large number of guesses for Wordle and I want to find the most common letters.

wordler.sh checks your Wordle guesses and reports how many possible words are left.

spelling-bee.sh takes 7 letters and reports on how many words can be made from them, with the first letter of your input being used in each word.

UnmountAllButSmallest.sh unmounts drives while leaving the smallest disk mounted.  This is for disk operations while booted from a Linux live USB that tries to mount any drives that it finds, but you would prefer them to be unmounted and available for cloning/partitioning
